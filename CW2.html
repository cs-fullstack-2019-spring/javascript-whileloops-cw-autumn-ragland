Write a While loop that counts backwards from 10 to 0
Log the current count at the end of each iteration EXCEPT if the current count is 5
HINT: Use continue //instructions

<script>

    var count = 11;     //set first number as 11 to account for first subtraction

    while (count >= 1)      //set parameters as less than or equal to 1 to account for first subtraction
    {
        count = count -1;   //subtract 1 from variable to count down
        if (count == 5)     //if the variable after subtraction is 5 do not print current count
        {
            continue
        }
        console.log("Current count is : " + count);     //print string and variable
    }
